The forum service appears to be misconfigured. It's requiring authentication for the registration endpoint (/auth/register), which should be publicly accessible. Please check the forum service's Spring Security configuration and ensure it allows public access to authentication endpoints. Common fixes:

1. Add .permitAll() for /auth/register in SecurityFilterChain
2. Check SecurityFilterChain order (authentication endpoints should be configured before protected routes)
3. Verify the forum service is running with the correct security configuration

Once the forum service is properly configured, the forum-cli should work correctly with the current settings.
