This is a placeholder for the logo files.

To create proper logo files:

1. For favicon.ico:
   - Create a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon file
   - You can use online tools like favicon.io

2. For logo192.png:
   - Create a 192x192 pixel PNG file
   - Use your application's logo

3. For logo512.png:
   - Create a 512x512 pixel PNG file
   - Use your application's logo

You can use any image editing software or online tools to create these files.

Alternatively, you can download placeholder images from:
- https://placehold.co/192x192
- https://placehold.co/512x512

For the time being, the React application will run, but you'll see 404 errors
in the console for the missing image files.
